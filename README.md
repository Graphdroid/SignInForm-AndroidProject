# SignInForm-AndroidProject
The project is very simple where I have designed the simple sign in form and I have used the navigation component for navigating from one fragment to another fragment. I have also desing the views very nicely by using shapes and material design.

These is my first project and I am trying to add new features. I am also finding some developer to have collaboration with these project to include more features.
